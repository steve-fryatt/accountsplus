<chapter title="Introducing Accounts+" file="Intro">

<cite>Accounts+</cite> is an accounting program that can be used to keep track of home accounts, over up to 10 bank accounts. Details are entered as transactions between two places, and the software builds up &lsquo;bank statements&rsquo; (see 'B.2: Viewing Accounts'), which can be viewed.  Standing orders can be automatically controlled (see 'D.5: Automatic Transactions'), and income from or expenditure to certain places can be calculated (see 'Section C: Headers').

The most &lsquo;important&rsquo; features are:

<list>
<li>Support for up to 10 interconnected bank accounts, between which transfers of money can take place.
<li>Up to 30 transactions which can take place automatically, at any time interval specified.
<li>Up to 30 expense headers definable, over any period of time required, to calculate income or expenditure.
<li>Full integration of date information, allowing transactions to be ordered by date quickly and easily.
<li>Support for import of CSV, TSV and Account files, maintaining compatibility with other software.
<li>Export in any of CSV, TSV, ASCII, and Account formats, allowing data to be used in other packages.
<li>Direct support for printers, allowing account details to be printed out quickly in a neat, &lsquo;draft&rsquo; format.
<li>Full, on-line, interactive help provided for all dialogue boxes and windows.
</list>


<subhead title="Loading Accounts+">

<cite>Accounts+</cite> requires RISC&nbsp;OS&nbsp;3.11 or later to work correctly. It will not work under the older RISC&nbsp;OS&nbsp;2 operating system. <cite>Accounts+</cite> was developed on RISC&nbsp;OS&nbsp;3.5, and is consequently RiscPC compatible.

To load <cite>Accounts+</cite>, double-click on the <file>!Accounts+</file> icon in a directory viewer. This loads <cite>Accounts+</cite>, and installs its icon on the right hand side of the iconbar. Click on this icon to open the <window>Transaction</window> Window (see 'A.3: The Transaction Window').

The loading window will open, and remain on screen until you click the mouse.


<subhead title="The Transaction Window">

This is the main window of the program, in which all the editing is done. Along the top of the window is a toolbar showing the status of the software and optionally giving access to features through a 'button-bar' (see 'Section F: The Preferences').  Along the bottom is an editing bar, allowing editing of individual transactions.

From left to right, the buttons on the button-bar (if visible) are:

     Edit Accounts            (see 'B.1: Creating and Editing Accounts')
     View Accounts            (see 'B.2: Viewing Accounts')
     View Balances            (see 'E.6: Viewing Balances')
     Standing Orders          (see 'D.5: Automatic Transactions')
     Headers                  (see 'Section C: Headers')
     Save File                (See 'A.5: Saving and Loading Accounts Files')
     Goto                     (see 'E.2: Goto Line')
     Search                   (see 'E.1: Searching')
     Clear Selection          (see 'D.2: Editing Transactions')
     Delete Transaction       (see 'D.4: Deleting and Removing Transactions')

On the far right of the toolbar is the name of the accounts that are being edited (see 'E.4: User Title'), and to the left of this the total balance in all the accounts.  Finally, in the centre the current date &ndash; as used by standing orders (see 'D.5: Automatic Transactions', and 'E.0: Dates') &ndash; is displayed.

If the button-bar is not displayed, then a status-bar is shown instead. This shows information about the selected transaction and other operations. See 'Section F: The Preferences' for more information on how to select these features.

The editing bar is explained in 'D.2: Editing Transactions'.

Clicking MENU over the Transaction window will display the main menu.

  |  Print...       PRINT  |  See 'B.4: Printing Accounts'
  +------------------------+


Other Menus
-----------

Accounts+ contains some other menus: there is the View Accounts menu, which
is available from several places and allows you to view the different
accounts, and the Accounts menu which contains the different account names
for entering into writable fields.  There are also lists of headers available
for the same purpose.


A.5: Saving and Loading Accounts Files
--------------------------------------

To save Accounts files, select 'Save' from the main menu.  Type in a
filename, and drag the icon to a directory viewer to save.  If a full
pathname is present, click on 'OK', select 'Save', or press RETURN to save. 
Pressing F3 can either open the save box, or save the file to the last
pathname: see 'Section F: The Preferences' for more details.

The full pathname of a file is shown in the title-bar of the Transaction
Window (see 'A.3: The Transaction Window'), or '<Untitled>' if the file has
not been saved.  If any modifications have not been saved, the file name is
followed by an '*'.

To load files, drag their icons to the Accounts+ icon on the icon-bar, or
double-click on them in the filer window.  If Accounts+ is not yet loaded, it
will load itself automatically.  Only one file can be loaded at any one time.

The Save box can also be accessed from the 'Save File' button on the
button-bar of the Transaction Window (see 'A.3: The Transaction Window').


A.6: Importing Files
--------------------

Accounts+ can load data in from other file formats as well as its own:
Account Files (from !Accounts), CSV files, and TSV files.  To import a file,
drag its icon to the Accounts+ icon on the icon-bar, or to the Transaction
Window (see 'A.3: The Transaction Window').  The transactions contained in
the file are always added to the end of those already entered: after a file
has been imported, it may be necessary to re-sort the transactions (see 'E.3:
Sorting By Date').


CSV Files
---------

CSV Files are used to transfer data from other applications (both on Acorn
machines and on PCs) into Accounts+.  Most applications such as databases and
spreadsheets can produce CSV Files easily.

On dragging a CSV file to Accounts+, the Import CSV window will open.  This
window contains two sections: one controlling how the file is loaded, the
other how the fields are mapped across.

Import as controls how the file is loaded.  Select 'Transactions' to treat
each line of the CSV file as one transaction from the Transaction Window. 
Select 'Account' to treat each line a one line from an account.  Enter the
account to which you wish to add the file into the box on the right by
clicking SELECT on the menu icon and choosing an account name from the list.

To be treated as transactions, CSV files must usually have the following
fields (although not necessarily in this order - see below):

  "23/09/83","Account 1","Account 2",23.87,"A Transaction"
       \          \          \         \           \
        Date       From       To        Amount      Description

To be treated as part of an account, the fields must be like this (although
again not necessarily in this order):

  "23/09/83","Account 1",0,23.87,"A Transaction"
       \          \       \     \         \
        Date       From/To Debit Credit    Description

Accounts+ will take this line and insert the name of the account as set in
the Import CSV window into the relevant 'From' or 'To' field (depending on
whether the line is a debit or a credit).  Although it may not be immediately
obvious, lines loaded to an account will end up in the Transaction Window
anyway; but they will always have one account in common.

Any valid names of headers and other accounts (which must be case specific as
usual) will be converted as they are loaded; all other text will become a
standard entry.

Once the Import as section is set up, the Map Fields section must also be set
up.  This changes depending on whether 'Transactions' or 'Account' is set,
and shows which field of the CSV file is loaded into which field of the
transaction.  The fields of a CSV file are as shown here:

  "23/09/83","Account 1","Account 2",23.87,"A Transaction"
       \          \          \          \          \
        Field 1    Field 2    Field 3    Field 4    Field 5

To set the fields, click on the up and down arrows to the right of the boxes. 
If a field is set to 'None' then either a null string '', or zero '0' will be
entered as appropriate instead.  Note that text can either be in double
quotes "line this", or on its own like this.

Once the widow is set up, click on 'Import' to load the transactions, or
'Cancel' to cancel the import.


TSV Files
---------

TSV Files are used to transfer data from other applications (both on Acorn
machines and on PCs) into Accounts+.  Most applications such as databases and
spreadsheets can produce TSV Files easily, even if they cannot produce CSV
files.

On dragging a TSV file to Accounts+ (which will have a Text file type), the
Import TSV window will open.  This window operated in much the same way as
the CSV window described above.

A line from a TSV file may well look like this (where [09] is a tab
character:

  23/09/83[09]Account 1[09]Account 2[09]23.87[09]A Transaction
       \          \           \           \          \
        Field 1    Field 2     Field 3     Field 4    Field 5

Note that, unlike CSV files, TSV files do not usually have their text inside
double quotes.

Once the widow is set up, click on 'Import' to load the transactions, or
'Cancel' to cancel the import.


Account Files
-------------

Account files provide a means of loading files created in the !Accounts
software.  When an Account file is dragged to Accounts+, the Import Account
window will open.

Account files can only be loaded into one account within Accounts+.  Choose
this account in the field at the top of the window: click SELECT on the menu
icon and select an account from the list.  As with CSV files, new lines will
be added to the end of the account, but subsequent sorting may rearrange
this.

If your file contains some dates within the descriptions in the Accounts
date formats, setting 'Extract dates' will remove them and insert them into
the 'Date' field within Accounts+.  The rest of the description will be
placed in the 'From/To' field.  The formats are:

  DD/MM/YY    (eg. 03/11/75)
  DD Mmm YY   (eg. 03 Nov 75)
  Mmm DD YY   (eg. Nov 03 75)

If one of these dates cannot be found, then the 'Date' field will be left
blank.  These transactions will be sorted to the start of the list if the
transactions are sorted.

Account files also contain an initial balance.  Initial Balance controls how
this is dealt with.  The default 'Ignore new' will simply ignore the new
balance, leaving the balance in Accounts+ intact.  'Replace old' on the other
hand, will replace the initial balance in Accounts+ with the one from the
Account file.  'Add old and new together' will add the two balances together.
'Insert transaction' will insert a special transaction with the 'From/To'
text of 'Merged account' (a standard entry) and a description of 'Initial
Balance', containing the amount of the new initial balance.  Enter the date
that you wish this transaction to occur on into the Date box, in the usual
format.

When the window is set up correctly, click on 'Import' to begin the importing
process, or click 'Cancel' to cancel the operation.

<chapter title="Bank Accounts" file="Accounts">

B.1: Creating and Editing Accounts
----------------------------------

Accounts can be created, deleted, or their names edited from the Account
Names window.  Select 'Accounts:Edit...' from the main menu,
select 'Edit accounts...' from the account menu, click on the 'Edit Accounts'
button in the button-bar in either the Transaction Window (see 'A.3: The
Transaction Window') or the Account Window (see 'B.2: Viewing Accounts'), or
press Shift-F7.

Initially, this window will contain only one account, called 'Untitled'.  To
edit the name of the account, click on its name, and use the Name field in
the Edit Account Name window to change the name.  Click on 'OK' to register
the change, 'Cancel' to forget the change, or 'Delete' to delete the account.
Note that it is not possible to delete an account used in a transaction.

To create a new account, click on 'Add'.  This will create a new account
called 'Untitled', assuming there are less than 10 accounts already present. 
Click on 'OK' to close the Account Names window.


B.2: Viewing Accounts
---------------------

To view one of the accounts, the Account window is used.  Select the name of
the account from the 'Accounts:View accounts:' sub-menu of the main menu,
from the 'View accounts:' sub menu of the account menu, or from the 'View
Accounts' button in the button-bar of either the Transaction Window (see
'A.3: The Transaction Window') or the Account Window (see below).

A 'bank-statement' window will open, showing all the transactions concerning
the account.  The 'From/To' column contains the names of the sources and
destinations of the transactions (see 'D.1: Entering Transactions').

The button-bar (if visible) contains the following buttons from left to
right:

     Edit Accounts          (see 'B.1: Creating and Editing Accounts')
     View Accounts          (see below)
     View Balances          (see 'E.6: Viewing Balances')
     Initial Balance        (see 'E.7: Initial Balance')
     Expense Headers        (see 'Section C: Headers')
     Export File            (see 'B.3: Exporting Accounts')
     Goto                   (see 'E.2: Goto Line')
     Print                  (see 'B.4: Printing Accounts')

There may also be two more options available: this depends on whether
selctions can be made and edited from the Account Window (see 'Section F: The
Preferences').  These are:

     Clear Selection        (see 'D.2: Editing Transactions')
     Delete Transaction     (see 'D.4: Deleting and Removing Transactions')

At the right hand side is the user title (see 'E.4: User Title'), and to the
left of this, the total balance currently in the account shown.  If the
button-bar is not displayed, then a status-bar is shown instead.  This shows
information about the selected transaction and other operations.  See
'Section F: The Preferences' for more information on how to select these
features.

Negative numbers are shown in the highlight colour so that they stand out,
and they are also, of course, prefixed by a minus sign ('-').

Only one account can be viewed at any one time.  If there are too many
transactions for an account to handle (over 500), then you will be warned of
this.  The last displayed transaction will be displayed in the highlight
colour (usually red, see 'Section F: The Preferences' for details on how to
change this colour), to indicate that there are more transactions not shown. 
To solve this problem, remove some old transactions from the start of the
file (see 'D.4: Deleting and Removing Transactions').

Clicking MENU over the Account Window will display the account menu.


B.3: Exporting Accounts
-----------------------

Accounts+ allows you to export account information in four formats: Plain
ASCII text, Comma Separated Variable, Tab Separated Variable, and Account
format: for use in Accounts.  To export an account, open the Account Window
for the account that you wish to export, and then open the relevant save box.
(see also 'A.6: Importing Files').

Account files are used for loading into the older !Accounts software. 
Account files can also be loaded back into Accounts+, but some data will be
lost in the process.

Either select 'Accounts:Export:Account' from the main menu; 'Export:Account'
from the account menu; click SELECT on the 'Export File' button in the
Account Window button-bar; or press Shift-F3 to open the Export Account
window.

A save window will open showing an Account file icon.  Enter a file name as
usual, and drag the file icon to a directory viewer.  If you enter a full
path-name, you can click on 'OK' or press RETURN.  The name of the account to
be exported is shown blow.  'Dates' turns the exporting of dates on and off
(see below).

Due to the limitations of the Account file format, the data is treated
rather strangely.  Since the fields do not match those used by Accounts
files, the information is treated as follows.  If 'Dates' is set, the
contents of the 'From/To' field is truncated to 12 characters, and the date
added to the end in the Accounts 'DD/MM/YY' format, to make up the 20
character Accounts description. This allows the date to be updated in
Accounts with the Ctrl-T date operation.  If 'Dates' is unset, the full 20
characters of the 'From/To' field is exported.  Credits, payments, and
balances are placed in the relevant columns.  Since there is nowhere for it
to go, the description from Accounts+ is ignored.  This system if far from
ideal (!), but there does not appear to be a better alternative.


CSV Files
---------

CSV files are used for transferring data to other software such as
spreadsheets, databases, and word processors; both on Acorn machines and on
other platforms.  These files can be loaded back into Accounts+

Either select 'Accounts:Export:CSV' from the main menu; 'Export:CSV' from the
account menu; click SELECT on the 'Export File' button in the Account Window
button-bar; or press Ctrl-F3 to open the Export CSV window.

The usual save window will open, type a file name into the box, and drag the
icon to a directory viewer to save; alternatively, type in a full pathname,
and press RETURN or click 'OK'.  The name of the account to be exported is
shown in the window.

'Line numbers' toggles the line numbers on and off; 'Headings' toggles on and
off the column headings: which will be saved as the first line if requested. 
'Quotes' determines whether or not text is enclosed in double quotes "like
this".

A typical line from a CSV file with 'Quotes' on may look like this:

  1,"04/07/1965","Access",20.00,0,1453.98,"Fuel"
   \         \     \       \     \      \     \
    Line No.  Date  From/To \     Credit \     Description
                             Debit        Balance
Without 'Quotes':

  1,04/07/1965,Access,20.00,0,1453.98,Fuel
   \        \     \       \  \      \    \
    Line No. Date  From/To \  Credit \    Description
                            Debit     Balance

Some applications require all text to be enclosed in quotation marks to be
able to understand the file.


TSV Files
---------

TSV Files are used for transferring data to other applications which cannot
read CSV files, especially word processors (such as Impression); both on
Acorn machines and other platforms.  The files can be loaded back into
Accounts+.

Either select 'Accounts:Export:TSV' from the main menu; 'Export:TSV' from the
account menu; or press Shift-Ctrl-F3 to open the Export TSV window.

The usual save window will open, type a file name into the box, and drag the
icon to a directory viewer to save; alternatively, type in a full pathname,
and press RETURN or click 'OK'.  The name of the account to be exported is
shown in the window.

'Line numbers' toggles the line numbers on and off; 'Headings' toggles on and
off the column headings: which will be saved as the first line if requested.

A typical line of a TSV file may look like this:

  1[09]17/12/1978[09]D. Jones[09]0[09]27.98[09]132.37[09]Items
   \        \           \         \      \       \         \
    Line No. Date        From/To   Debit  Credit  Balance   Description

Note that the '[09]' specifies the ASCII code 9 (it would be shown like this
in some text editors), and is the Tab code.


ASCII Text Files
----------------

ASCII Text  Files are used for saving formatted data to other applications. 
The data is tabulated using a fixed space font (such as the System font, or
Corpus).

Either select 'Accounts:Export:ASCII Text' from the main menu; or
'Export:ASCII Text' from the account menu to open the Export ASCII Text
window.

The usual save window will open, type a file name into the box, and drag the
icon to a directory viewer to save; alternatively, type in a full pathname,
and press RETURN or click 'OK'.  The name of the account to be exported is
shown in the window.

'Line numbers' toggles the line numbers on and off; 'Headings' toggles on and
off the column headings: which will be saved as the first line if requested. 
'Date & File' will save the date and file in the following format at the top
of the file:

     File: SF Accounts
  Account: Abbey National
     Date: 14/05/1995

A whole example may well look like this:

     File: SF Accounts
  Account: Abbey National
     Date: 14/05/1995

     Date    From/To             Debits   Credits   Balance Description
  11/04/1994 Payment                       500.00    500.00 Account Opened 
  01/04/1995 Withdrawal           21.59              478.41 


B.4: Printing Accounts
----------------------

Accounts can be printed out to provide a paper record of the transactions. 
To print, open the Account Window for the account that you wish to print, and
then select either 'Accounts:Print...' from the main menu, 'Print...' from
the account menu, click SELECT on the 'Print' button in the Account Window
button-bar (see 'B.2: Viewing Accounts'), or press PRINT.  The Print
Account window will open.

At the top of this window is the name of the account to be printed.  Select
the lines that you wish to print from the Print section: 'All' for all the
lines, or 'From #� To #�' to print only the lines from line #� to line #�
inclusive.  The Margins section controls the space around the printed page,
in either lines or columns.  'Page length' is the overall length of the page,
including margins.  This is usually set to 62 or 64 for dot-matrix printers. 
'Top' is the number of lines left at the top of the page, and 'Base' the
number of lines left below.  Together, these calculate 'Lines', which is the
resulting number of printable lines.  'Left' is the left margin, while
'Right' is the right margin.  These values are updated to reflect the choices
made in the Options section.

Options contains options on how the page is printed.  'Line numbers' turns
the line numbers on the left of the page on and off, while 'Headings'
controls the column headings ('Date', 'From/To', 'Description', etc.).  Turn
on 'Page numbers' to print the number of each page at the bottom.  'File &
Account name' shows the User Title (see 'E.4: User Title') and the account
name at the top of each page, and 'Date' will include the date as well.

When these values are set, click on 'Print' to print the page, or 'Set
values' to store them.  'Save values' will save the values as the defaults. 
Click on 'Cancel' to forget any changes made to the settings.

An example page containing the full works may look like this:

       File: Accounts                           Account: Current Account
                       Date printed: 02/06/1987

B.5: Controlling the Printer
----------------------------

Accounts+ uses its own printer control system, to allow high speed printouts
to be achieved.  For this reason, it does not use the standard RISC OS
printer drivers.  To set up Accounts+, use the Printer Control window.  Click
on 'Control...' in the Print window, click ADJUST on the 'Print' button in
the Account Window button-bar (see 'B.2: Viewing Accounts'), select
'Printer...' from the icon-bar menu, or press Shift-Ctrl-PRINT.  This window
contains a list of control codes that are sent to the printer to access its
features.  The codes required can be found in your printer's manual.

Codes are entered into the white boxes.  To send an ASCII code, simply enter
its value; to send a string, enclose it in double quotes, "like this".  Items
in this list are separated by commas.  For example, the IBM proprinter code
to print a pound sign ('�') is 'ESC ^ 156'.  This means send the ESC code
(ASCII 27), followed by a '^', followed by ASCII 156.  To enter this into the
Control window, you would use '27,"^",156'.  Similarly, to turn underline on
on the IBM proprinter, the sequence 'ESC - 1' is needed.  This would
translate to '27,"-","1"'.  Note that the ASCII codes for '^', '-', and '1'
(94, 45, and 49 respectively) could have been used instead, but their textual
equivalents are easier to remember.  An example:

   27,"^","-",156
   /   \   \   \
ESC    '^' '-'  ASCII Code 156

The codes required are as follows.  Any codes left blank will not be sent to
the printer, meaning that their effects will not appear on paper.

Start Print Job  This is the first code sent to the printer, at the start of
                 a print.  It can be used to swap emulation, reset the
                 printer, or carry our any other tasks that may need to be
                 done.

End Print Job    This is the very last code that is sent to the printer,
                 after all the printing has been finished.  It can be used to
                 clear the printer, swap emulation, or carry out any other
                 task.

Pica Pitch On    This is the second to last code to be sent to the printer,
                 and is used to reset the pitch to Pica, which is the default
                 on dot-matrix printers.  THIS CODE MUST ALWAYS BE INCLUDED
                 IN THE CONTROL LIST.

Elite Pitch On   This is the second code that is sent to the printer, and is
                 used to select Elite pitch, to allow all the columns to fit
                 onto a page.  THIS CODE MUST ALWAYS BE INCLUDED IN THE
                 CONTROL LIST.

Bold On          These codes are sent to the printer to turn bold print on
Bold Off         and off.

Italic On        These codes are sent to the printer to turn italic print on
Italic Off       and off.

Underline On     These codes are sent to the printer to turn underline on and
Underline Off    off.

Line Feed        This code is sent to the printer at the end of each line,
                 and must move the print head down one line, and over to the
                 left margin.  IT MUST ALWAYS BE INCLUDED IN THE CONTROL
                 LIST.

Form Feed        This code moves the print head to the end of a page.  IT
                 MUST ALWAYS BE INCLUDED IN THE CONTROL LIST.

'�' Mapping      Because ASCII is an American standard, the pound sign ('�')
                 does not have a standard code number, and is left to the
                 printer and computer manufacturers to decide upon.  This
                 means that each printer has a different code to print a '�'. 
                 Use this box to enter a code sequence to print a '�', if it
                 varies from the Epson '163' as used by Acorn computers. 
                 This code often involves switching character sets, printing
                 the '�', and then switching back again.

Once the codes have been set, click on 'OK' to store them, or 'Save' to save
them as defaults.  Click on 'Cancel' to forget any changes.

<chapter title="Headers" file="Headers">

C.1: What Are Headers?
----------------------

Headers are a means of keeping track of how you spend and receive money. 
They can be used in transactions, in the same way as accounts, as either a
source or destination for money.  The total amount of money paid to a header
is noted, as well as the amount of money received from one.  The total
balance of these payments is also calculated.  Headers can be set to be only
payments, only credits, or both.  For example, a header called 'Wages' could
be defined only to be a credit, and would show how much money you have
received from wages over a given time; or a header called 'Computer related'
could show how much you have spent on your computer over time.  If an area is
intended to be self-sustaining, setting a header for both credits and
payments would show how much it is making - or losing - you over a certain
period.

Headers are entered into the 'From' and 'To' fields of transactions in the
usual way.


C.2: Creating Headers
---------------------

Headers can be created and edited from the Headers window.  Select
'Headers:Edit...' from the main menu, click ADJUST on the 'Expense Headers'
button in the button-bar in either the Transaction Window (see 'A.3: The
Transaction Window'), or the Account Window (see 'B.2: Viewing Accounts'),
or press Shift-F8.  This opens the Headers window, containing a scrolling
list of headers.

To add a new header, click on 'Add', and a new header called 'Untitled' will
be added to the end of the list.  Only 30 headers can be defined.  To edit
this header, click on its name, and the Edit Header window will open.  The
name of the header can be set in the Name field.

The Type field controls the type of header.  Select 'In (From)' to allow the
header to be used in the 'From' field as a a payment into an account; or 'Out
(To)' to allow it to be used in the 'To' field as a payment out of an
account.  Both these options can be selected together, allowing a header to
appear in both fields.

Between Dates sets the range of dates for which that particular header is
calculated: for example, all the expenditure on the car for three months. 
Date from is the date on or after which the header is used, while date to is
the date on or before which it is used.  Obviously, if the date from is after
the date to, the header will never be used.  Enter the dates in the form
'DD.MM.YYYY', depending on how the preferences are set (see 'Section F: The
Preferences').  If a field is left blank, then no limit is set.

Click on 'OK' to save the changes, or 'Cancel' to forget them.  'Delete' will
delete the header.  All references to it within the file are converted to
standard entries (see 'D.1: Entering Transactions').  If this results in two
standard entries in a transaction, then the transaction becomes meaningless.

After new headers have been added, it may be necessary to update the file
(see 'E.8: Updating Transactions').  This will make sure that any standard
entries matching the new headers' names will be made into headers.


C.3: Viewing Headers
--------------------

To view the values of the headers defined, open the Header Transactions
window, either by selecting 'Headers:View transactions...' from the main
menu, clicking SELECT on the 'Expense Headers' button in the button-bar in
either the Transaction Window (see 'A.3: The Transaction Window'), or the
Account Window (see 'B.2: Viewing Accounts'), or pressing F8.

This window shows a table of all the headers.  The name is shown on the left,
followed by the type.  This can either be 'In' for credits, 'Out' for
payments, or 'I/O' if both flags are set.  'Date From' and 'Date To' show the
dates between which the header is calculated, while 'In' and 'Out' show the
credits and payments of that header respectively.  'Balance' shows the
overall balance of the header (which can be negative).


C.4: Exporting Headers
----------------------

If you wish to use the information displayed in the headers Header
Transactions window in another application, then the information can be
exported.  Three formats are supported: CSV files, TSV files, and ASCII text
files.


CSV Files
---------

CSV files are used for transferring data to other software such as
spreadsheets, databases, and word processors; both on Acorn machines and on
other platforms.

To export the header information as a CSV file, select 'Headers:Export:CSV'
from the main menu.  The usual save window will open, and you can type a file
name into the box, then drag the icon to a directory viewer to save;
alternatively, type in a full pathname, and press RETURN or click 'OK'.

'Headings' toggles on and off the column headings: which will be saved as the
first line if requested.  'Quotes' determines whether or not text is enclosed
in double quotes "like this".

A typical line from a CSV file with 'Quotes' on may look like this:

  "Counter Credit","In","04/02/86","23/11/91",376.99,0,376.00
     \               \      \          \         \    \    \
      Header Name     Type   Date from  Date to   Amounts   Balance

Without 'Quotes':

  Counter Credit,In,04/02/86,23/11/91,376.99,0,376.00
     \            \     \         \       \   \    \
      Header Name  Type  Date from Date to Amounts  Balance

Some applications require all text to be enclosed in quotation marks to be
able to understand the file.


TSV Files
---------

TSV files are used for transferring data to other software such as
spreadsheets and word processors (for example Pipedream); both on Acorn
machines and on other platforms.

To export the header information as a TSV file, select 'Headers:Export:TSV'
from the main menu.  The usual save window will open, and you can type a file
name into the box, then drag the icon to a directory viewer to save;
alternatively, type in a full pathname, and press RETURN or click 'OK'.

'Headings' toggles on and off the column headings: which will be saved as the
first line if requested.  A typical line from a TSV file may look like this
(where [09] is a tab character):

  Counter Credit[09]In[09]04/02/86[09]23/11/91[09]376.99[09]0[09]376.00
     \               \      \          \         \    \    \
      Header Name     Type   Date from  Date to   Amounts   Balance


ASCII Text
----------

ASCII Text files are used to export the header information in a formatted
way.  The columns are tabbed out using spaces, and will appear correctly if
used with a monospaced font such as Corpus.

To export the header information as an ASCII Text file, select
'Headers:Export:ASCII Text' from the main menu.  The usual save window will
open, and you can type a file name into the box, then drag the icon to a
directory viewer to save; alternatively, type in a full pathname, and press
RETURN or click 'OK'.

'Headings' toggles on and off the column headings.  'Date & File' turns on
and off the date and file name, which are printed at the start of the file
in the following format if requested:

  File: SF Accounts
  Date: 20/09/1992

A typical file may look like this, with 'Date & File' selected:

       File: SF Accounts
       Date: 20/09/1992

  Counter Credit   In  04/02/86 23/11/91   376.99     0.00   376.00
  Withdrawal       Out 07/05/90              0.00   498.44  -498.44


C.5: Printing Headers
---------------------

Headers can be printed out to provide a paper record of their values.  To
print, select 'Headers:Print...' from the main menu, or press Shift-PRINT. 
The Print Headers window will open.

The Margins section of this window controls the space around the printed
page, in either lines or columns.  'Page length' is the overall length of the
page, including margins.  This is usually set to 62 or 64 for dot-matrix
printers.  'Top' is the number of lines left at the top of the page, and
this will calculate 'Base', the number of lines left below.  Together, these
calculate 'Lines', which is the resulting number of printable lines.  'Left'
is the left margin, while 'Right' is the right margin; which is calculated
from 'Left'.  These values are updated to reflect the choices made in the
Options section.

Options contains options on how the page is printed.  'Headings' controls the
column headings ('Date From', 'Type', 'Balance', etc.).  'File & Account
name' shows the User Title (see 'E.4: User Title') and the account name at
the top of each page, and 'Date' will include the date as well.

When these values are set, click on 'Print' to print the page, or 'Set
values' to store them.  'Save values' will save the values as the defaults. 
Click on 'Cancel' to forget any changes made to the settings.

An example page containing the full works may look like this:

                            File: Accounts
                       Date printed: 02/06/1987

</chapter>





<chapter title="Transactions" file="Trans">

D.1: Entering Transactions
--------------------------

To enter transactions, the edit bar at the bottom of the Transaction Window
(see 'A.3: The Transaction Window') is used.  This shows the same fields as
the Transaction Window itself, and information can be typed into it.  To put
the caret into the bar, click in one of the white boxes.  TAB can be used to
move the caret forward through the boxes, and Shift-TAB to move it back.

The 'Date' field contains the date of the transaction.  These are entered in
the form 'DD.MM.YYYY', depending on how the preferences are set (see 'Section
F: The Preferences').  To use the current date (as shown in the tool bar -
see 'A.3: The Transaction Window'), select 'Today's date', and the date field
will disappear.  Whenever the line is used, the current date will be
substituted instead.

The 'From' column indicates the source of the transaction.  This can be an
account, a header (see 'C.1: What Are Headers?'), or a standard entry. 
Standard entries are entries that are not used in any calculation - ie. they
are not account or header names - and can be any text up to 20 characters in
length.  Only one of the two entries of a transaction (either 'From' or 'To')
can be a standard entry: either one or both must be a valid account or
header.  Standard entries are often used for one off payments, for which a
header cannot be justified.  The money will be transferred from the source
specified by this field.

'To' is the opposite of 'From' - the money will be transferred to this
destination.  Again it can be an account, a header, or a standard entry.  To
enter account names quickly into either the 'From' or 'To' fields, click
SELECT on the menu button button below the field, and select an account name
to be inserted.  To use a header, click ADJUST on the same button; only the
appropriate  headers are shown below each field.  Header and account names
can be typed into the fields by hand, but note that they are case sensitive. 
If an inappropriate header is typed into a field (a 'From' header into the
'To' field or vice versa), then the entry is made into a standard entry.

'Amount' carries the amount of money transferred.  This can be entered in the
form 123.45 (for �123.45) or 123 (for �123).  The 'Description' field
contains a textual description of the transaction, useful if both 'From' and
'To' are either accounts or headers.

To add the transaction to the end of the list, select 'Edit:Add to end' from
the main menu, click on the 'Add To End Of Transaction List' button in the
edit-button-bar (see 'D.2: Editing Transactions'), or press F1.  Pressing
RETURN after entering data into the fields will move the caret along the
line, and pressing RETURN in the last 'Description' field can also add the
transaction (see 'Section F: The Preferences').  The transaction will be
added, and the transfer of money from the source in the 'Form' field to the
destination in the 'To' field will be noted.  There can be up to 5000
transactions in the file.


D.2: Editing Transactions
-------------------------

To edit transactions, use is made of the edit bar, below the Transaction
Window (see 'A.3: The Transaction Window').  This includes the edit-tool-bar
on the bottom right.  This contains the following buttons from left to right:

     Clear Edit Line                   (see below)
     Cut Selection                     (see 'D.3: Copying Transactions')
     Copy Selection                    (see 'D.3: Copying Transactions')
     Replace Selection                 (see below)
     Insert Above Selection            (see below)
     Insert Below Selection            (see below)
     Add To End Of Transaction List    (see 'D.1: Entering Transactions')

On the bottom left is a single icon.  This is the Help Icon, and clicking it
will let you view the !Help File.  It also provides information to
Interactive Help applications.

To select a transaction, click on it in the Transaction Window.  It will
appear highlighted, both in the Transaction Window and in the Account Window
(see 'Section F: Preferences' for more details about this).  This makes the
'greyed-out' menu items and buttons in the button-bars available.

Selecting 'Edit:Insert above' from the main menu, clicking on the 'Insert
Above Selection' button in the edit-button-bar (see above), or pressing
Shift-INSERT will insert the contents of the edit-bar above the selected
transaction in the Transaction Window.  To insert the line below the selected
transaction, either select 'Edit:Insert below' from the main menu, click on
the 'Insert Above Selection' button in the edit-button-bar (see above), or
press INSERT.  If the order of dates is not correct, then the transactions
can be sorted into date order (see 'E.3: Sorting By Date').

It is possible to replace the contents of the selected transaction with the
contents of the edit-bar.  Selecting 'Select:Replace selection' in the main
menu, clicking on the 'Replace Selection' button in the edit-button-bar (see
above), or pressing Ctrl-V will replace the transaction.  This becomes useful
when copying transactions (see 'D.3: Copying Transactions').

To clear the selection, select 'Selection:Clear selection' from the main
menu, click on the 'Clear Selection' button in the button-bar in the
Transaction Window (see 'A.3: The Transaction Window'), the 'Clear Selection'
button in the button-bar in the Account Window if present (see 'B.2: Viewing
Accounts', and 'Section F: The PReferences'), or press Ctrl-Z.


D.3: Copying Transactions
-------------------------

In order to edit a transaction, it must first be either cut or copied to the
edit-bar (see 'D.1: Entering Transactions').  To cut a selection, select
'Selection:Cut selection' from the main menu, or click on the 'Cut Selection'
button in the edit-button-bar.  This will copy the selection to the edit-bar,
and delete it from the Transaction Window.  To copy the selection, leaving it
in the Transaction Window, either choose 'Selection:Copy selection' from the
main menu, click on the 'Copy Selection' button in the edit-button-bar, or
press Ctrl-C.

Copying makes it possible to amend transactions.  Select the transaction, and
copy it to the edit-bar.  Then amend it, and replace it to the Transaction
Window using the replace function (see 'D.2: Editing Transactions').


D.4: Deleting and Removing Transactions
---------------------------------------

To delete a transaction totally from the list, select it, and then choose
'Selection:Delete selection' from the main menu, click on the 'Delete
Selection' icon in the button-bar in the Transaction Window (see 'A.3: The
Transaction Window'), the 'Delete Selection' button in the button-bar in the
Account Window if present (see 'B.2: Viewing Accounts', and 'Section F: The
PReferences'), or press Ctrl-X.  The accounts will be recalculated after the
line is deleted.

If the number of transactions becomes too large (Accounts+ can only handle
5000 transactions in total, and 500 per account), it is possible to remove
transactions from the start of the file.  Select the transaction up to and
including which you wish to remove, and choose 'Selection:Remove
transactions' from the main menu.  After the lines have been removed, the
appropriate balances will be inserted into each account's initial balance
(see 'E.7: Initial Balance'), so that, unlike deleting lines, the account
balances remain correct.


D.5: Automatic Transactions
---------------------------

If your accounts involve transactions that occur on a regular basis - for
example standing orders or direct debits - then Accounts+ can enter these
transactions into your accounts on the correct days.  Up to 30 such automatic
transactions can be defined.

To edit the automatic transactions, open the Standing Orders window: either
by selecting 'S.Orders:Edit...' from the main menu, by clicking SELECT on the
'Standing Orders' button in the button-bar in the Transaction Window (see
'A.3: The Transaction Window'), or by pressing Shift-F6.  This window shows a
list of all the transactions currently defined: initially it will be empty.

To add a new transaction, click on 'Add', and one called 'Untitled' will
appear at the end of the list.  To edit this, click on its name, and the Edit
Standing Order window will open.  This window contains four sections.

Name contains the name of the transaction: this can be up to 20 characters
long, and will be used to identify the transaction; as well as being inserted
into the 'Description' field when the transaction is used.  Type specifies
how the interval between transactions is calculated.  'Every # months' will
insert the transaction every # months (for example, on the 2nd day every 3
months - the day is derived from the start date: see below).  'Every # days'
will leave an interval of # days between each transaction.  Up to 2 digits
can be entered into each box.

Transfer describes the transaction that will take place.  Enter into the '�'
box the amount of money to be transferred (as '123.45' or '123').  In From,
enter the source of the transaction (the 'From' field), and in To the
destination (the 'To' field).  Clicking SELECT on the two menu buttons will
allow account names to be entered, clicking ADJUST will allow headers to be
entered.

Finally, Next Transaction contains the date when the transaction will next
occur.  Enter the first date in the form 'DD.MM.YYYY', depending on how the
preferences are set (see 'Section F: The Preferences').  When editing an
existing transaction, this field will show the next date.  If the date is set
behind the current date, the next time the automatic transactions are
updated, transactions will repeatedly be added to bring the date up to the
present day.  If the field is left blank, then the transaction will be
ignored (so this can be used to disable an automatic transaction without
deleting it).

Click on 'OK' to record the changes, or 'Cancel' to forget any changes made. 
Click 'Delete' to delete the definition from the list.  When editing is
complete, click 'OK' on the Standing Orders window to close it.

The automatic transactions can be updated automatically when Accounts+ is
loaded, or at midnight - if the software is running at that time.  The
transactions can also be brought up to date by selecting 'S.Orders:Update'
from the main menu, or clicking ADJUST on the 'Standing Orders' button in the
button-bar in the Transaction Window (see 'A.3: The Transaction Window'). 
Depending on the preferences, you will be warned when standing orders are
added (automatically or not), and the transactions will be sorted into date
order again.  It is also possible to have Accounts+ confirm if more than a
certain number of transactions are added: this saves locking up the machine,
and filling your file up if you enter a start date wrongly.  See 'Section F:
The Preferences' for more details on these features.


D.6: Viewing Forthcoming Automatic Transactions
-----------------------------------------------

If you wish to find out what transactions were added last time your file was
updated, or you wish to know what transactions are due to hit you bank
account in the next few days, select 'S.Orders:Forthcoming...' from the main
menu, or press Ctrl-F6.  This opens the Forthcoming Standing Orders window,
which lists all those standing orders which were added last, and all those
which will be added in the near future.  Those which have been added are
shown highlighted (see 'Section F: The Preferences').

See 'Section F: The Preferences' for more details on this feature.


D.7: Exporting Transactions
---------------------------

If you wish to use the Transactions in another application, then the
information can be exported.  Three formats are supported: CSV files, TSV
files, and ASCII text files.


CSV Files
---------

CSV files are used for transferring data to other software such as
spreadsheets, databases, and word processors; both on Acorn machines and on
other platforms.  These files can be loaded back into Accounts+.

To export the transactions as a CSV file, select 'Transactions:Export:CSV'
from the main menu.  The usual save window will open, and you can type a file
name into the box, then drag the icon to a directory viewer to save;
alternatively, type in a full pathname, and press RETURN or click 'OK'.

'Headings' toggles on and off the column headings: which will be saved as the
first line if requested.  'Quotes' determines whether or not text is enclosed
in double quotes "like this".

A typical line from a CSV file with 'Quotes' on may look like this:

  "04/02/86","Barclays","Counter Credit",376.99,"A Transaction"
       \          \             \           \           \
        Date       From          To          Amount      Description

Without 'Quotes':

  04/02/86,Barclays,Counter Credit,376.99,A Transaction
      \        \           \           \         \
       Date     From        To          Amount    Description

Some applications require all text to be enclosed in quotation marks to be
able to understand the file.


TSV Files
---------

TSV files are used for transferring data to other software such as
spreadsheets and word processors (for example Pipedream); both on Acorn
machines and on other platforms.  These files can be loaded back into
Accounts+.

To export the transactions as a TSV file, select 'Transactions:Export:TSV'
from the main menu.  The usual save window will open, and you can type a file
name into the box, then drag the icon to a directory viewer to save;
alternatively, type in a full pathname, and press RETURN or click 'OK'.

'Headings' toggles on and off the column headings: which will be saved as the
first line if requested.  A typical line from a TSV file may look like this
(where [09] is a tab character):

  04/02/86[09]Barclays[09]Counter Credit[09]376.99[09]A Transaction
      \           \              \             \            \
       Date        From           To            Amount       Description


ASCII Text
----------

ASCII Text files are used to export the header information in a formatted
way.  The columns are tabbed out using spaces, and will appear correctly if
used with a monospaced font such as Corpus.

To export the transactions as an ASCII Text file, select
'Transactions:Export:ASCII Text' from the main menu.  The usual save window
will open, and you can type a file name into the box, then drag the icon to a
directory viewer to save; alternatively, type in a full pathname, and press
RETURN or click 'OK'.

'Headings' toggles on and off the column headings.  'Date & File' turns on
and off the date and file name, which are printed at the start of the file
in the following format if requested:

  File: SF Accounts
  Date: 20/09/1992

A typical file may look like this, with 'Date & File' selected:

       File: SF Accounts
       Date: 20/09/1992

  04/08/1992 My Bank        The Garage        27.03 Service
  05/08/1992 Fred Co.       My Bank          200.00 My Commission


D.8: Printing Transactions
--------------------------

The details of the transactions can be printed out to provide a permanent
record.  To do this, select 'Transactions:Print...' from the main menu, or
press Ctrl-PRINT.  The Print Transactions window will open.

At the top of this window is the Print section.  Select 'All' to print all
the transactions, or 'From #� to #�' to print all the transactions from #� to
#�.  Enter the required values into the boxes.  The Margins section controls
the space around the page.  Use the up and down arrows to adjust the values. 
'Top' is the number of lines left at the top of each page, and 'Base' the
number of lines left below.  'Left' and 'Right' are the columns left to the
left and right of the page respectively (these may change if 'Transaction
numbers' is selected.  'Page length' is the total number of lines on a sheet
of paper, and 'Lines' is the number of lines left, excluding the margins.

The Options section controls what is printed on a page.  'Transaction
numbers' will print these numbers on the left of each line, while 'Headings'
prints the column headings ('From', 'To', 'Date', etc) at the top of each
page.  'Date' and 'File name' print the current date and the User title (see
'E.4: User Title') at the top of each page, and 'Page number' will print the
page number at the bottom.

When ready, click on 'Print' or press RETURN to print.  'Set values' will
store the current settings in memory, while 'Save values' will save them to
disc for future use.  'Cancel' will cancel the printing.

<chapter title="Miscellaneous Features" file="Misc">

E.1: Searching
--------------

The search function allows you to search for a piece of text within the
'From', 'To', and 'Description' fields.  Select 'Transactions:Find...' from
the main menu, click on the 'Search' button in the button-bar in the
Transaction Window (see 'A.3: The Transaction Window'), or press F4 to open
the Search and Replace Window.

Enter the string that you wish to search for into the Search for box.  To
enter an account or a header, click on the menu button to the right of the
field.  If you wish to replace the matches with something else, then enter
this into the Replace with box, otherwise leave it blank.  Again, the menu
button to the right allows accounts and headers to be entered.

Search Options controls how the search will take place.  Select 'Whole
string' to search only for a complete match, or 'Sub string' to search for a
match within text: for example, 'in' would match 'mind'.  'Case sensitive'
toggles case sensitivity on and off: determining whether the case of the
letters is taken into account.  Select the fields to search from the Search
Columns section.  Toggle the 'From', 'To', and 'Descriptions' fields on and
off as required.

To start the search by finding the first match, click on 'Find First'.  To
simply replace all occurrences, click on 'Replace All'.  Click 'Cancel' to
cancel the search.

If 'Find First' was chosen, and a match is found, the Match Found window will
open.  This shows the actual text found, the text to replace the match with,
the field it was found in ('From', 'To', etc.), and the line (transaction)
matched.  The transaction will be selected.  To move on to the next match,
click on 'Find Next'.  Clicking on 'Replace' will replace the text found with
the replace text (if 'Sub string' was selected, then only the part matched
will be replaced: for example, if 'in' was matched by 'mind', and the replace
string was 'owe', then the result would be 'mowed'), while 'Replace All' will
replace all the occurrences from the current line onwards to the end of the
file.  Click on 'Cancel' to cancel the search.


E.2: Goto
---------

Goto allows you to jump to any transaction either in the Transaction Window,
or in the Account Window.  To go to a transaction in the Transaction Window,
either select 'Transactions:Goto transaction' from the main menu, click on
the 'Goto' button in the button-bar in the Transaction Window (see 'A.3: The
Transaction Window'), or press F5, and the Goto Line window will open.  Type
the line number into the box, and click on 'OK' or press RETURN, and the
Transaction Window will jump to the transaction entered.

To go to a line in the Account Window, select 'Goto line' from the account
menu, click on the 'Goto' button in the button-bar in the Account Window (see
'B.2: Viewing Accounts'), or press Shift-F5 to open the Goto Line window. 
Type in the line number, and click on 'OK' or press RETURN to jump to the
line entered.

To go to the currently selected line or transaction in either the Transaction
Window or the Account Window, click ADJUST on the 'Goto' button in the
relevant button-bar.  Assuming a transaction is selected, and that it is
shown in the Accounts Window (if you wish to go to a line), then the window
will scroll to the selection.

E.3: Sorting By Date
--------------------

If the transactions in the Transaction Window are not in date order, it is
possible to sort them.  Select 'Transactions:Sort by dates' from the main
menu, or press F6.  This can be useful if new transactions have been added to
the end of the file, out of sequence.  If a date has been left blank, it will
be sorted to the beginning of the file.

Note that it is possible to sort the file automatically after standing orders
have been added: see 'Section F: The Preferences' for more details.


E.4: User Title
---------------

The User Title is a name of up to 20 characters which appears both in the
Transaction window (see 'A.3: The Transaction Window'), and in the Account
Window (see 'B.2: Viewing Accounts').  To change this (it is initially set as
'Untitled'), select 'Misc:User title' from the main menu, or press Ctrl-T. 
Enter a new name into the box, click on 'OK' or press RETURN, and the new
title will be displayed.


E.5: Clear File
---------------

To clear the program back to the state it was when it was first loaded: 1
account, no headers, transactions, etc, select 'Misc:Clear file'.  Use this
with caution, since you can not retrieve the data once it has been cleared.


E.6: Viewing Balances
---------------------

To view the balances of all the accounts, as well as the total overall
balance, use the Account Balances window.  Either select 'Accounts:View
balances...' from the main menu, select 'View Balances...' from the account
menu, click on the 'View Balances' button in the button-bar in either the
Transaction Window (see 'A.3: The Transaction Window') or the Account Window
(see 'B.2: Viewing Accounts'), or press F7.


E.7: Initial Balance
--------------------

The initial balance of an account is the balance used to start the account,
from which all the other balances are calculated.  It is shown in the top
line of the Account Window (with the description 'Initial Balance').  The
initial balance is zero to begin with, but can be changed, either by the
user, or when lines are removed (see 'D.4: Deleting and Removing
Transactions').

To set the initial balance, select 'Initial balance' from the account menu,
or click on the 'Initial Balance' button in the button-bar of the Account
Window (see 'B.2: Viewing Accounts').  Type the new amount into the box (as
123.45 for �123.45, or 123 for �123), and click on 'OK' or press RETURN to
set the new initial balance.


E.8: Updating Transactions
--------------------------

When new headers are added, or other changes made, it may be necessary to
update the file to make sure all the transactions recognise the new headers
or accounts.  For example, if a standard entry (see 'D.1: Entering
Transactions') is called 'cheque', and subsequently a header called 'cheque'
is defined, then it will not update the standard entry.  To do this, select
'Transactions:Update transactions' from the main menu.  It will go through
the file, replacing standard entries where necessary.

E.9: Keyboard Shortcuts
-----------------------

The following keyboard shortcuts are used by Accounts+.  Note that if another
application has input focus, then the hotkeys may not work.  In this case,
give Accounts+ input focus, by clicking in the edit bar to give it the caret.

           F1 ..  ..  ..  .. Add Transaction to End

E.0: Dates
----------

Dates obviously form an integral part of Accounts+.  The date used as the
current date is shown in the toolbar of the Transaction Window (see 'A.3: The
Transaction Window'), in the form 'Sat, 27th June 1965'.  This is the date
used throughout the application.  The date is obtained from the System
Clock, and can be set using the !Alarm application supplied with the
computer.  If, for any reason, the date is not available, or is set to a
totally unrealistic value (as deemed by Accounts+), then the text 'No Date'
will appear instead in the Transaction Window.  If this is the case, then any
dates added to the file will be incorrect, and standing orders will not
operate automatically.

The date can also be set by the user - click SELECT on the date field, or
select 'Misc:Set date' from the main menu to do this.  Select 'USe system
date' for the dates to work as described above; select 'Other date' and enter
a date in the box in the usual format to use another date.  This date will be
shown in the Transaction window in the form '27/06/1965', to indicate that it
is a user date.  It is advisable to turn off automatic standing orders (see
'Section F: The Preferences') when altering the date in this way.

See 'Section F: The Preferences' for more details on how dates work.

</chapter>





<chapter title="The Preferences" file="Prefs">

The preferences allow Accounts+ to be set up to operate in the way you want. 
To open the Preferences Window, select 'Preferences...' from the icon-bar
menu.  This window contains a scrolling list of options, divided into
sections.  These are described below.

When the preferences have been changed, click on 'OK' to set them, or 'Save'
to save them to disc as defaults.  Click on 'Cancel' to forget the changes.


Display
-------

This controls the display in the main windows: the Transaction Window (see
'A.3: The Transaction Window'), the Account Window (see 'B.2: Viewing
Accounts'), the Account Balances window (see 'E.6: Viewing Balances'), and
the Header Transactions Window (see 'C.3: Viewing Headers').

'Use outline font' determines whether an outline font is used to display the
text.  Turn the option off to use the System font - for speed.  If your
computer is fast enough, then an outline font is neater.

If Accounts+ is running on a Risc PC, then the 'Desktop font' option will
become available when 'Use outline font' is selected.  this option will cause
Accounts+ to display text in the outline font used on the desktop, updating
itself when required by the WIMP. 

The font used by Accounts+ if 'Desktop font' is not selected can be specified
by setting the system variable <Accounts+$Font>.  This is best set in the
!Run file as follows:

Shift-Double-Click on the !Accounts+ icon in a directory viewer to open the
!Accounts+ application directory.  Load the file called '!Run' into a text
editor: Shift-Double-Click to load it into !Edit.  The line

  Set Account+$Font Homerton.Medium

can be changed to use any outline font in your system.  The spaces in the
line must be left intact.  Save the !Run file back to where it came from, and
close the directory viewers.  The next time Accounts+ is loaded, the new font
will be used.

Another example might be:

  Set Account+$Font Trinity.Bold.Italic

'Show grid' toggles the grid on and off in these windows.

The colours can be set to change the appearance of the four windows.  To set
a colour, click either on the menu button to the left of the coloured box, or
over the coloured box itself, and select the desired colour from the menu. 
The colours are as follows:

     Grid colour        The colour of the grid shown in the windows (only
                        available if 'Show grid' is on).
     Text colour        The colour of the text.
     Background colour  The colour of the window background.
     Selection colour   The highlight (background) colour of the selected
                        line in the Transaction Window.
     Repeat colour      The highlight (background) colour of the selected
                        line in the Account Window (if shown, see below).
     Highlight colour   The colour used to highlight items (not select them)
                        in the main windows.

Button-bars
-----------

This controls the appearance of the button-bars in the windows.  If the bars
are turned off, then a status bar will appear in their place.  'Button-bar
over transaction window' controls the Transaction Window's button-bar, while
'Button-bar over account window' controls the button-bar in the Account
Window.

See 'A.3: The Transaction Window' and 'B.2: Viewing Accounts' for more
information.


Confirmation
------------

Confirmation allows you to specify which actions you wish to be warned about.
All those included involve some data loss.  If an option is set, a message
will appear before the action can be carried out.  The subjects are fairly
obvious.


Standing Orders
---------------

This section controls the operation of the automatic transactions (or
standing orders).  'Automatic standing orders' turns the automatic update on
and off.  When on, standing orders are updated, and transactions added to the
file, when Accounts+ is loaded, and at midnight.  When off, the user must
update standing orders automatically, using 'S.Orders:Update' in the main
menu.  If 'Warn of new standing orders' is set, a message will indicate how
many transaction have been added to the file.

Setting 'Sort after new standing orders' will sort the file into date order
after standing orders have been added.  If this is off, it may be necessary
to sort the file manually, by selecting 'Misc:Sort by dates' from the main
menu, or pressing F6.

Set 'Confirm excess additions' to force Accounts+ to stop and check for
confirmation if too many standing orders are added.  This is useful, since it
stops the machine 'hanging' while it adds transactions.  This may happen if a
date in entered incorrectly, for example.  If the standing orders are
correct, then the user may simply ask to continue.  The 'After # additions'
sets the number of transactions added before this confirmation takes place.

Setting 'Show additions in forthcoming list' will show those transactions last
added in the Forthcoming Sanding Orders window.  'Display # days ahead'
specifies how many days into the future this list goes.  It can be set to 0
to show only those orders just added.

See 'D.5: Automatic Transactions' and 'D.6: Viewing Forthcoming Automatic
Transactions' for more information.


Dates
-----

Set 'Use system date' to use the date from the system clock - this is the
usual method of operation.  Select 'Other date' to use a different date - as
entered in the box.

The rest of Dates allows control over the way dates are entered and
displayed.  'Display full century' will display dates in the form DD.MM.YYYY
in the windows and boxes when on, and in the form DD.MM.YY when off.  This
does not affect the entering of dates, which is controlled by 'Expand from
decade'.  If this is set, then a date entered as 20.09.76 would be expanded
to 20.09.1976 (or to whichever century was specified, see below).  When
turned off, the date would remain as 20.09.76 (the year 76 AD.).  Entering
dates in the form DD.MM.YYYY is always permissible.

'Expand from' sets the century to which dates are expanded.  The first year
of the century is entered (ie. 1900 to expand 64 to 1964).

Note that none of this affects the day and month.  The date 7th April 1981
could be entered as 07.04.1981 or even 7.4.1981.

'Separation' indicates the separator used between the parts of the date: in
02/05/77 the separator is '/'.  This can be set to the following
characters: ':', '-', '.', and '/'.  Note that the symbol chosen must be used
when entering dates.

Note that this section affects dates everywhere in Accounts+, including when
saving and printing files.

See 'E.0: Dates' for more information.


Miscellaneous
-------------

Miscellaneous contains options which would not fit in anywhere else.  'Return
caret on adding' will move the caret back to the left of the enter bar when
the transaction is added.  This can speed up data entry.

When set, 'F3 performs quicksave' will cause pressing F3 to save the file to
the current file name (as shown in the title-bar.  If this shows
'<Untitled>', then this will not work.  When not selected, pressing F3 will
open the save box.

'Beep for message window' will cause a beep when the message window opens. 
'Provide interactive help' will cause Accounts+ to support the !Help
application (or any others that imitate it, for example 'Bubble Help'). 
'Show selection in account window' will highlight the selected line in the
Account Window (when relevant).

If 'Show selection account window' is chosen, then 'Select from account
window' will become available.  When ticked, clicking over a line in the
Account Window will select that line (it will also be selected in the
Transactions Window).  Two extra options will appear in the button-bar of the
Account Window: allowing you to delete the selected line, and clear the
selection.

File Types
----------

Currently, Accounts+ uses a file type from end-user area.  This means that
there is a chance that it may clash with other software that you use.  If you
wish to change the filetype, then this is possible.  You must edit the
!RunImage file (access this by Shift-Double-Clicking on !Accounts+ in a
directory viewer, then Shift-Double-Clicking on !RunImage).  Change the line

  file_type_accounts%=&0AD

that appears close to the top of the file (about 4 or 5 lines down) so that
the '0AD' on the end is the new file type, and re-save the file.  DO NOT
ALTER ANYTHING ELSE.

You must now edit the !Sprites file, so that the sprites 'file_0ad' and
'small_0ad' also use the new file type.  This is so that the icons are shown
correctly.  Save the !Sprites file again.

Finally, load the !Boot and !Run files into a text editor (again,
Shift-Double-Click on them), and find the lines

  Set Alias$@RunType_0AD Run <Obey$Dir>.!Run %%*0
  Set File$Type_0AD Accounts

You must change the 0AD in each line to the new file type.  Again DO NOT
CHANGE ANYTHING ELSE.  Save both files, and close the !Accounts+ directory. 
If you have already saved some Accounts files, you must change their file
types now.  This can be done by clicking menu over them (you can select
several together) and choosing 'Files:Set type'.  Type 'Accounts' into the
field, and click on it.

Now load !Accounts+, and the change will be complete.


My 'Wish List' for the Future
-----------------------------

One of the problems of coding a program like Accounts+ is that you can always
think of more things that you would like it to do.  The major obstacles in
the way of implementing any more features are time, and the size of the
program - 180Kb is very large for a piece of BASIC code.  However, I will
continue to develop Accounts+, and try and remove any bugs that are still
hiding within the code.

Some ideas that I am currently considering are listed below.  I cannot
guarantee that any of them make their way into BASIC, and some of them are
obviously impractical.  Still, there's always a chance...

  * Printing accounts and headers using the RISC OS Printer Manager.  This
    would allow for the use of the Outline Font Manager, and for some degree
    of page control.  The code should not be difficult, but can I justify it?

  * Some form of graphing capability would be a possibility.  It would be
    nice to be able to create and view graphs of your accounts, without
    having to rely on exporting to other packages.  In this way, the graphs
    could also be dynamic with the data.

  * The ability to view several accounts at once would be an advantage, but
    this would require a large amount of internal restructuring.  Multiple
    file editing would be, I should think, impossible.

I would also like to further optimise the screen redraw, which is still
fairly sluggish, especially with outline fonts; and I will, of course,
continue to correct any bugs that come to light.


Other Points
------------

Accounts+ was coded in BASIC V on a Risc PC, with an ARM 610 processor, and
so may feel sluggish on older machines (especially ARM 2 and ARM 250 A30x0
ones).  If this is a problem, use the System font for screen display.

Accounts+ is under development, and so may not correspond exactly with the
descriptions given in this file (this may also be due to the size of this
file - writing 85K of help text is very tedious!).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
I offer no guarantee as to the suitability of Accounts+ or any related
software for any purpose, and will not be held responsible for any loss or
damage caused indirectly or directly from the use of the software.  I do not
offer any guarnantee as to the stability of Accounts+, or to the accuracy of
its results.

The code may not be altered in any way.
